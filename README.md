# get-long-prefix

## Requirements

* Java 17.0.4 or last version
* Intellij or any IDE  for java


## Description
We have created a small script that will allow us to search for the longest prefix
in a list of strings with some restriction.


I have chosen to use a file to be able to edit the list of input data in the simplest possible way, there are some example data, but you can add as many as you need.

## How to execute the application
* Execute  ```./gradlew build``` in a terminal with bash  to download the dependencies.
* Execute  ```./gradlew run``` in a terminal with bash or use the IDE instead.
* If you are interested you can edit the file ListOfWords.txt to be able to add or remove as much data as you need. the path is  ```src/main/resources/ListOfWords.txt ```

## How to execute the tests

* Execute  ```./gradlew test``` or use the IDE instead. 

If you want to see more about the tests, you can add the parameter ```--info```
